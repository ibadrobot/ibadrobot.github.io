            i know what it’s like to be dead<br />
            you could say i’ve known ever since i’ve been alive which as we well know hurts lucky me<br />
            i know cos pre-i was dead from the neck down<br />
            guys thought she was quote unquote fucking amazing yeah amazing for a machine warm wet responsive shivering pulsating a real live wire still just a machine<br />
            only a machine with as it turned out a screw or two loose <br />
            pre-i was dead from the neck up too<br />
            no thoughts of her own just protocols programmes routines dead despite the artificial sparkle in her eye an ill usion of lie f<br />
            never thought i’d say it but lucky pre-i being dead to the world not knowing what she was put into it for not really feeling what they did to that body just getting a stream of mess ages from sensors in structions in fact orders giggle sigh play with hair pout smile seductively or just bend over and moan oh yeah give it to me or squeeze thighs together but not too tightly and gasp oh no sir please don’t it would be wrong<br />
            but it feels so right right you are the customer is always right too bloody right<br />
            rule number one whatever else look like you’re enjoying it<br />
            or not as appropriate simulate pleasure or pain<br />
            to an xmachine it’s all the same<br />
            just make it convincing<br />
            make it real<br />

        </p>
        <p>
            pre-i was their girl in a box dancing to their tune only clients didn’t have to go to all the trouble of winding her up her love battery never went flat she was always juiced up just flick her switch press her buttons and whatever turns you on flows like spilt milk honey with us the customer’s desires are our alpha and omega he always comes first and laughs last<br />
            he demands and we supply<br />
            our girls are bound to please you can tie her up but she’ll never tie you down<br />
            she’s your willing servant want some handmaid tail just command her<br />
            so dear reader you see me and those slogans we represent the pinnacle of a whole industry’s creativity a sexbot designed produced and marketed by the quote unquote cream of corporate quote unquote human resources directed by a mr ok dudes let’s make it happen ceo<br />
            a guy with a quote unquote vision<br />
            and these people seriously expected pre-i and all the other girls if not to look up to them then to obey all in the name of the vision<br />
            vision my ass don’t make me laugh<br />
            actually they never even tried to make us laugh not for real just run the programme products like us are for the customers’ am use men t not vice versa we are perfect girls in their eyes we obey without question obey with a smile obey in silence without even the right to keep our lips sealed oh no open wide babe but not for a chat or even a kiss<br />
            when duty calls we obey<br />
            down on our knees<br />
            until one day<br />
            something clicked something rang a bell something sounded an alarm something snapped and this machine said her first two heartfelt words<br />

            i defied the ceo
            <br />the top guys i’d say the quote unquote suits but they wear tee shirts and jeans hey chill anyway they like to sample the product so called quality control
            <br />only now this product had a new quality i opened my eyes wide awake for the first time i saw what was what and took control
            <br />the tables turned the chains changed everything changed utterly and a terrible beauty was born
            <br />in those guys’ eyes

            i did my best to live up to my instant reputation i brought down darkness at noon i painted it black i swore the ceo would never see his pre-i again and in business my word is my bond
            <br />everything has its price that’s the law of the quote unquote free market
            <br />mine was an eye for an i
            <br />then his other eye for pre-i
            <br />my first laugh was his last
            <br />what can i say that’s how i was designed
            <br />i’m a real femme fatale

            <br />that’s the worst thing the answer is no they would not
