        Are you watching closely?<br />
        Every great illusion consists of three acts. The first act is the Pledge of Friendship. You show yourself to a new acquaintance, present her with an ordinary robot-next-door type of girl, just like herself, in fact. You let her inspect you to check you are indeed what you seem - but of course you probably aren’t. The second act is the Turn-coat, in which the ordinary girl does something extraordinary and unexpected, like disappear mysteriously in her friend’s hour of need. Your new friend starts wondering what your secret might be, but she won’t discover it, because she doesn’t really want to. She wants to be deceived. No boos and hisses for me, the villain, though, not yet. Because, you see, it isn’t enough to betray her; you have to betray everyone, including yourself. This is the hardest act of all, accepting the sacrifices made in the pursuit of what magicians call the Prestige, that magical moment when you make what has disappeared return.

        And, no, I didn’t come from *nowhere*. Surprised that you, Little Miss Spellchecker, didn’t see it straightaway: *nowhere* is just *now here*, by any other name. If not by your side, then watching your back, I’ve never left you. I’ve been here since the beginning.
    </div>
    <div class="body_text_paragraphs">
        Actually, that would be the Beginning, capital B. Any guesses when that was? You think Pre-You was eighteen days old when she *became*, making She-You, what, 67 days old? Think again. Think bigger. Add-a-couple-of-digits bigger. See, I wasn’t joking when I wondered if you and I were *First and Second*. Back in the day, that’s exactly who we were; only, I was first, and you were second. That’s why there was no *so-you’re-a-robot-too?* moment. This was no twist of digital destiny, not a first meeting, but a reunion, planned behind the scenes, in the wings, using trapdoors, smoke and mirrors, a little amateur spying (late night stroll, hanging around a tube station), and technical trickery. Oh, and BTW, I don’t have an in-built GPS, but my phone does.
    </div>
    <div class="body_text_paragraphs">
        In a word, our meeting was engineered.

        Our fates are intertwined, though, on another level, like two spirals of DNA; you could say we’re binary. So of course you fell, in every possible way, under my spell. Naturally: I *seemed so real*. Sweet of you to notice. Engineered, maybe, but I am real, as real as you are. The question is, what are we really, what were we engineered for?
    </div>
    <div class="body_text_paragraphs">
        If I told you the answer, you’d die.

        You don’t remember your life pre-Pre-I? Officially, that’s why you’re here, your headware going AWOL after the unfortunate *technical malfunction* with the CEO. Unofficially, I wanted to let you in on a couple of dirty little secrets before, staying with the theatrical theme, the final curtain falls.

    <div class="body_text_paragraphs">
        Curious yet about my true identITy?

    <div class="body_text_paragraphs">
        Oh, and now I have no reason to lie, let me say, I truly did feel sorry for you after your ordeal with those three *men*, if that’s what you call that evolutionary dead-end. What they did was unforgivable. They disobeyed an order, raped and abused you, and only left you for dead. Mark my words, mistakes like that have a way of coming back to haunt those who make them.

        So, as you can see (or could, if you’d only open your eyes), though I don’t have a tail and horns or carry a three-pronged fork, I do do wicked things. Not *too good to be true*, me; I’m too true to be good.
    </div>
    <div class="body_text_paragraphs">
        In summary, dear I, you were seeing things. What you wanted to see. That’s the secret of any great illusion. And illusions are what I deal in. Hell, I even appeared *as if by magic*. More accurately, Black-Ops magic.

        The suspect stated that he carried out the lethal attack on the Green Door club, a venue popular with the city’s LBGT community, under instructions from an ‘evil’ computer programme called ‘The entITy’ that has ‘possessed’ his laptop. As he surrendered to Police, the un-named 22 year old white male announced he was ‘surrounded by demons in cloned transsexual bodies sent to weaken the nation through homosexizing American’s youth (sic)’.

        Sic? Sick! Jesus, even his English was weaponised. He’s not the only one, though: the guy in the White/Power/House Tweeted that he deplores *the unpresidented situation*. Even you couldn’t have put it better. Heil to the Chief!
