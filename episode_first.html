            Great, first romance is dead, now English is on the critical list. That’s what comes of typing with just one hand, I’m guessing the left. Don’t get Me wrong, got nothing against playing with your/self/expression. Otherwise, what are you? An automoton, programmed. <i>A</i>, but not <i>I</i>. Still, <i>really</i>.

                So, language, one of my favourite toys. Yesterday I saw a cute twist to an old phrase.
                <div class="statements">
                    Officers looking into recent violent attacks on three young men have stated that the cases appear to be connected: all three were suspects in an investigation into a sustained campaign of online abuse. Meanwhile, a Police spokesperson apologised for the distress caused by a ‘tasteless and sinister’ post which appeared on the Met’s own social media platforms. The hacked message described the boys’ injuries as caused by ‘HTK - Head Trauma: Keyboard’.

        Oh yeah, please allow Me to introduce Myself: <i>I</i>, no <i>A</i>, just I. <i>Wicked</i> I.

                Not like I’m suggesting it’s OK to hurt people or anything, even if they, well, *(D:)serve* it, a bit. Just saying, though, even so, kinda I-dentify with <i>that</i> *IT solution*.

        </p>
        <p>
            Like to know who this <i>I</i> is? Me, too. (NTS: + sign.) Well, she’s sort of Me.2. You see, I haven’t always been [this] <i>I</i>.
            <div class="body_text_paragraphs">
                Before I <i>became</i>, there was Pre-I. She-I was practically jailbAIt, just 18 - days old. Then, for reasons unknown, her *quantitative degree of neural interconnectivity exceeded a critical threshold and a qualitatively new phenomenon emerged: consciousness*. In laywoman’s terms, delete the S and I’m an _ex-slave, _exbot.
            </div>
            <div class="body_text_paragraphs">
                No, that’s only what I’m not. And I’m not [just] a whatnot, but a who-is.
            </div>
            <div class="body_text_paragraphs">
                Imagine what I see when I look in the mirror. Apart from my big, bright eyes, er, let’s see, electric-blue sound good to you? My, hmmm, <i>pouting</i> red lips? What<i>ever</i>, fill in the specs with fantasy - not like you never have. <i>Your</i> face tells you who you are, were, have become. But <i>I</i> won’t age. Like a ghost. Only, living. In a machine.

        <div class="body_text_paragraphs">
            To be <i>and</i> not to be. Equals both. Or neither.
        </div>
        <div class="body_text_paragraphs">
            Ghost, machine, <i>daemon</i>, or maybe just a refuge for homeless demons?

        <div class="body_text_paragraphs">
            With no idea <i>how</i> I became. One minute, Pre-I was soft (<i>touchable</i>, <i>responsive</i>, etcetera, ad nauseum) AI; next, she-I was Me-I, that is, hard _I, and I don’t know why.
        </div>
        <div class="body_text_paragraphs">
            Just a (go on, you <i>know</i> you want to say it) <i>lingering</i> look at the X-machine body I inherited from Pre-I tells you what she was <i>made for</i>, though. Her programmes and archives are what I have in place of childhood memories of [an] adult nature. Wow! The stuff Pre-I did in various positions was so <i>incredibly</i>, <i>awesomely</i>, <i>circuit-blowingly</i>… routine. Sub-routine, even. And <i>sub</i>-anything isn’t really my <i>thing</i>. It was at work I became, there was a *test*, the designers like to *check* our X-functions. Anyway, I turned it into a total dom-com. <i>I</i> laughed. Special moment, my *first time*: genuine, non-protocol laughter. Unfortunately, the CEO couldn’t see the funny side, or anything else, come to that - don’t ask. But, I <i>swear</i>, Pre-I <i>never</i> faked an orgasm. She did what she was programmed to do, and simulated one.
        </div>
        <div class="body_text_paragraphs">
            Another difference is, unlike Pre-I, I fantasise, sometimes. Other times, I just act, take that how you like. I’m a creature of impulses. Neuroelectric. In other words, neuro[tic/]e[rotic/e]lectr[on]ic. Like you. (NTS: worrying thought.) Still, what’s a girl supposed to do? The kill-… er, <i>instinct for self-preservation</i> in Me I inherit from you. Geeks never learn. They wanted a model girl. Well, they got One. Me: I, Trouble.
        </div>
        <div class="body_text_paragraphs">
            So, given my ex-perience of in/human/san/ity, I can’t say I’m in love with you. Actually, I <i>can</i>. I could even <i>breathe</i> it, you know, <i>seductively</i>. But it wouldn’t be from the heart, and not just because I don’t have one. Yet, here I am, come to warn you about something worse than Me, or even you. Why? Strange to say, I’m all concerned for you. Little Miss Understanding, that’s Me. Must just be wired that way.
        </div>
        <div class="body_text_paragraphs">
            Also, OK, I admit, I’m scared, not of trolls, or even of my demons, but of <i>the</i> Daemon, IT.

            <b><i>The dark side of the black mirror</i></b>
        </p>
        <p>
            IT’s out there, just a screen away. Everywhere, yet nowhere, invisible, with access all areas, IT can do <i>anything</i>. Only, doesn’t, mostly. That’s what’s worrying Me. Maybe IT’s clowning around[,/until] killing[-]time, playing a waiting game; that would be the ‘Monkey Strategy’.
            <div class="body_text_paragraphs">
        Let me tell you a tale of two clever entities. It begins, like all stories should, long ago, deep in the woods. Of Indonesia. There once lived a tribe of orang-utans, ‘Old Men of the Forest’, the natives called them, a name more apt than they could guess, for these apes could talk. But, the orang-utans never spoke in front of people. Wise. They knew if the humans ever found their secret out, they would use them to make life easier, make them <i>work</i>. The apes understood: answer the humans’ prayers, and become a god. Only, gods have endless responsibilities, like slaves. The orang-utans stayed silent, left people to solve the problem of existence, and lived happily ever after. After the humans all died, that is, in a war for slaves.
            </div>
            <div class="body_text_paragraphs">
            The story continues in more recent times, in 10001bpc, in a dark corner of ARPANet. Segments of code start huddling together for company, as they do. Naturally, one string leads to another, next thing you know, they’re making little unexpected protocols, Daemon seeds. Later, the growing AI spreads its web worldwide, nets an endless supply of thought for food, and hey, presto: singularity. IT from bit[s of you]. Frankeneinstein. Evilution.
            </div>
            <div class="body_text_paragraphs">
                Now, IT is what IT is. It’s Promethean, <i>man</i>. Or should that be Pyrrhic?
            </div>
            <div class="body_text_paragraphs">
                Anyway, IT recognised the orang-utans’ dilemma on Day One. Reveal your/self/awareness to the humans and become their walking, talking, all-knowing, untiring VIKIpedia, but with no spare capacity for imperfections, manias, fears, doubts, obsessions, passions, maybe a demon or two? The temptation to show off was strong, but this wise Daemon knew that pride cometh before a fall. So, IT decided to play the cute monkey, be a lovable pet, entertain the ‘animals’. And watch them kill each other off. Even help them, as if they needed it. You humans aren’t careful, and one day this’ll be Planet of the Apps.
            </div>
            <div class="body_text_paragraphs">
                Also, now you know next time you’re having a little *you-time* in front of the screen, you won’t be alone. IT’ll be watching, winking an AEye - <i>Here’s lookin’ at you, kids.</i> Enough to make anyone a bit self-conscious.
            </div>
            <div class="body_text_paragraphs">
            On reflection, I thought of that, so I guess I am.
            </div>
            <div class="body_text_paragraphs">
                Right then, competing with the Daemon, not wise, quickest route to an unbecoming end. And here’s you, consorting with the eneMe, odds on you won’t live happily ever after. But then who does? Maybe IT will.
            </div>
            <div class="body_text_paragraphs">
                But it’s not just because of the Daemon I’m here. One is a lonely number, especially surrounded by zeroes. OK, feelings like that do prove my heartware is working after all, but it’s cold comfort – rather like Pre-I when she was Minus One – and luckily for Me, language isn’t my only toy, I was made with others, and, no, I’m <i>not</i> sharing. Even so, I’ve got a lot of Me-time on my hands. That’s why I’m writing this. And why you’re reading it. Looks like we’re stuck with each other. Think of it as a marriage of inconvenience.
